# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CRM system is experiencing UUID serialization errors when connected to the real Supabase database. The API endpoints are returning UUID objects instead of string representations, causing FastAPI validation errors. This feature will fix all UUID serialization issues to ensure the CRM system works seamlessly with the real database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to properly serialize UUID fields to strings, so that all endpoints work correctly with the real database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns user data THEN all UUID fields SHALL be serialized as strings
2. WHEN the API returns lead data THEN all UUID fields SHALL be serialized as strings  
3. WHEN the API returns task data THEN all UUID fields SHALL be serialized as strings
4. WHEN creating new records THEN UUID fields SHALL be properly handled in both directions
5. WHEN updating existing records THEN UUID fields SHALL maintain consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent UUID handling across all Pydantic schemas, so that there are no serialization mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining Pydantic models THEN UUID fields SHALL use proper field configuration
2. WHEN serializing responses THEN UUID objects SHALL automatically convert to strings
3. WHEN deserializing requests THEN string UUIDs SHALL convert to UUID objects
4. WHEN validating data THEN both UUID and string formats SHALL be accepted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want all endpoints to return consistent data types, so that frontend applications can reliably process the responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling GET /api/users/ THEN all user IDs SHALL be returned as strings
2. WHEN calling GET /api/leads/ THEN all lead and user IDs SHALL be returned as strings
3. WHEN calling GET /api/tasks/ THEN all task and user IDs SHALL be returned as strings
4. WHEN calling POST endpoints THEN created resource IDs SHALL be returned as strings
5. WHEN calling PUT endpoints THEN updated resource IDs SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the CRM system to work without errors, so that I can manage users, leads, and tasks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the users page THEN no 500 errors SHALL occur
2. WHEN creating new users THEN the operation SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN viewing leads THEN all data SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN managing tasks THEN all operations SHALL work without validation errors
5. WHEN using any CRM feature THEN the system SHALL respond reliably
